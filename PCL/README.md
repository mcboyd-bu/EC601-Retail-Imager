# EC601 Retail Product Imager

#### PCL Folder

C++ code from IntelRealsense PCL wrapper example "rs-pcl". Two files:

- RetailImager.cpp: *Production code used in demos*
- rs-pcl.cpp: *Original code used for development and testing; includes visualizations for verifying output* 

## How to use

The IntelRealsense library (SDK) must be installed and the [PCL wrapper example code](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/tree/master/wrappers/pcl "Intel RealSense: PCL Samples for Intel® RealSense™ cameras") built for your platform (Windows or Linux). 

Once built, the code here can replace the default code in rs-pcl.cpp.

*NOTE: This code was developed on Windows 10 with Visual Studio 2017. Getting the wrapper examples to work on Windows requires considerable effort beyond the Intel instructions listed above. It will work! You just have to deal with the errors one at a time. Maybe someday I will add all my steps here...*
